Table of asks from the biostatistics manager

| **ASK from Biostat Manager**  | **Description of the ASK** | **How the Biostatistician Can Accomplish It** |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Study Design Consultation    | Clarify the study's primary and secondary objectives, endpoints, and recommend appropriate study design. | Conduct discussions with the clinical team to understand the study goals and endpoints. Recommend designs based on objectives (e.g., parallel, crossover, adaptive). |
| Sample Size Calculation      | Provide sample size and power calculations based on effect size, variance, significance level, and power. Adjust for dropout rates. | Use statistical software (e.g., PASS, SAS, R) to perform calculations. Consider factors such as expected effect size, standard deviation, significance level, power, and dropout rates. |
| Randomization Scheme         | Develop a randomization plan detailing the method (e.g., simple, block, stratified) to ensure balance and minimize bias. | Design randomization procedures using statistical software or algorithms. Ensure proper implementation to maintain blinding and balance across treatment groups. |
| Interim Analysis Plan        | Outline the plan for interim analyses, including timing, statistical methods, and criteria for stopping the trial early. | Collaborate with the clinical team to determine appropriate interim analysis points. Use software tools to set up interim analysis protocols, ensuring proper control of Type I error. |
| Statistical Methods          | Specify statistical tests and models for analyzing endpoints, handling missing data, and performing subgroup analyses. | Document the choice of statistical tests in the SAP. Use statistical software to set up models and simulations for planned analyses. |
| Multiplicity Adjustments     | Describe methods for controlling Type I error when multiple comparisons are made. | Implement statistical techniques such as Bonferroni correction or false discovery rate in the analysis plan. Use software tools to apply these corrections. |
| Data Management Plan         | Provide input on data collection methods, database design, and data quality control procedures. | Work with data management team to design robust data collection and storage systems. Implement quality control checks and validation procedures. |
| Regulatory Compliance        | Ensure the study design and statistical methods comply with regulatory guidelines and ethical standards. | Review and adhere to ICH guidelines, FDA, and EMA requirements. Document compliance strategies in the SAP and study protocol. |
| Protocol Development         | Collaborate with clinical researchers and other stakeholders to integrate statistical considerations into the study protocol. | Participate in protocol development meetings. Provide written contributions to the protocol, particularly in sections related to statistical design and analysis. |
| Feasibility and Risk Assessment | Conduct feasibility analyses to assess the practicality of the study design, including potential recruitment challenges and resource requirements. | Perform feasibility studies and risk assessments. Use simulation tools and historical data to evaluate study design feasibility and identify potential risks. |
| Kick-off Meeting             | Participate in initial project meetings to understand study objectives, timelines, and resource allocation. | Engage with the clinical research team and other stakeholders during kick-off meetings to gather comprehensive project details. |
| Literature Review            | Conduct a thorough review of existing literature to inform study design and identify benchmarks. | Search and analyze relevant scientific literature, previous studies, and clinical trial results to inform the study design and parameters. |
| Collaborative Planning       | Engage with the clinical team to finalize the study design and statistical methodologies. | Work closely with clinical researchers to align on study objectives, design, and statistical methods. Conduct regular meetings to ensure alignment. |
| Draft SAP                    | Develop and circulate a draft SAP for review and feedback from the research team. | Write a detailed SAP document. Share with stakeholders for review and incorporate feedback. |
| Finalize SAP                 | Incorporate feedback and finalize the SAP, ensuring alignment with the study protocol and regulatory requirements. | Revise the SAP based on feedback. Ensure final document aligns with study protocol and regulatory standards. |
